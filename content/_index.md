Welcome! This site features NetHack monster images, as generated by the DALL-E&nbsp;3&nbsp;AI.

Find the illustrations from:

- [Monsters](monsters/)
- [Artifacts](artifacts/)

Find some ChatGPT&nbsp;4 AI-generated texts about NetHack here:

- [Texts](texts/)

And finally some AI-generated audio materials:

- [Audio](audio/)

The purpose of this site is twofold: first, obviously to illustrate the monsters, which normally are represented by just colored letters, but second, to document the state of generative AI as of late 2023.
