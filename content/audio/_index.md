## NetHack song

Here, I used [Suno](https://suno.com/) to create a NetHack song. I used ChatGPT to create the prompt for Suno, and after some iterations ended up with _"Epic NetHack song with humor: include YASD, diverse roles, iconic monsters/items, and the Amulet of Yendor"_, for which Suno gave the title _YASD and the Amulet_ and the following lyrics:

### Lyrics to _YASD and the Amulet_
\
**Verse**\
Once upon a time, in a dungeon so deep,\
There was a brave adventurer, ready to take a leap,\
Rolled a character, a valiant knight,\
But little did they know, they were in for a fright,\
\
**Chorus**\
YASD, YASD, what a silly way to go,\
YASD, YASD, it's the Amulet they'll never know,\
YASD, YASD, diverse roles and monsters too,\
In the world of NetHack, there's always something new, (ooh-yeah)\
\
**Verse**\
Next, they tried a wizard, with spells so grand,\
Casting fireballs, turning foes to sand,\
But beware the Medusa, with her piercing gaze,\
One look and you're frozen, lost in a daze
